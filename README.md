Rail Baron is a Great Game that's too slow, this is a companion tool to help you seep it up.

How It Works
==
Rail DDestinatr is a companion tool to Rail Baron, it doesn not replace Rail Baron.  The slowest part of the game is picking destinations and calculating payouts.  This tool attempts to speed up those two key processes by determining destinations for the players and keeping track of what the payout for reaching the destination is.  Most importantly BaronDestinatr allows you to keep using the dice if you prefer, just in case you don't trust computeres (If you do trust the computer to role destinations for you it can do that too).  You always roll your own dice for moving.
